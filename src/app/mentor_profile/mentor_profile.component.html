                    Jessica Pearson, managing partner, learns Mike's secret, but other issues take 
                    precedence when co-founding partner Daniel Hardman returns to the firm, pressuring 
                    Jessica and Harvey. Mike begins to foster a relationship with paralegal Rachel Zane, 
                    but finds himself pursuing other romantic entanglements after his grandmother's sudden 
                    death. Harvey and his secretary Donna face accusations of burying evidence and must 
                    discover the truth while keeping incriminating evidence from Hardman, who would use it 
                    to leverage a managing partner position. The intensifying threat from Hardman forces 
                    Jessica into a merger with a British firm headed by Edward Darby.

                    The Grimm fairy tale gets a Technicolor treatment in Disney's first animated feature. Jealous 
                    of Snow White's beauty, the wicked queen orders the murder of her innocent stepdaughter, but 
                    later discovers that Snow White is still alive and hiding in a cottage with seven friendly little 
                    miners. Disguising herself as a hag, the queen brings a poisoned apple to Snow White, who falls 
                    into a death-like sleep that can be broken only by a kiss from the prince.
